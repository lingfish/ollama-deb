# ollama-deb

This is a GitHub workflow to build Debian packages of [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/) based on tags.

It installs the same files as the binary tarballs that you can download from
[their releases page](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases), plus more.

The contents of the `.deb` file can be seen on the [releases page](https://github.com/lingfish/ollama-deb/releases).

It will also install, enable and start a systemd service, as well as add a system user to run ollama.  It also adds the
source documentation.

The package depends on `sysuser-helper`, so either install that first, or install these release packages, and then run
`apt-get -f install`.

Alternatively, more recent versions of `apt` can handle `.deb` file installation, plus dependency
handling -- the magic trick is to put a path in front of the filename:

```shell
host [01:34 PM] [j:0] /tmp # apt install ./ollama_0.3.14_amd64.deb

With respect to the shared libraries packaged by the ollama team, I don't know why they do this.  I've packaged them
here anyway, and updating your `ld.so.conf` etc is left as an exercise for the reader.  Realistically, there should be
a separate package for the libs.

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/lingfish/ollama-deb/releases) to download.
